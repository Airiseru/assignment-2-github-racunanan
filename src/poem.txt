THE SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFE
By Shaun Cronick

It's the simple things in life,
That make the world go round.
Like remembering a lost thought,
For a story that will astound.

The falling of an autumn leaf,
That spirals slowly down.
Your first taste of ice-cream,
The one called chocolate brown.

The bright colours of a rainbow,
That arc across the land.
Finally completing a majestic castle,
On sunny seaside sand.

The viewing of a raindrop as it,
Rapidly runs down a window pane.
Quickly chansed by many others,
On and on and forever again.

Feeling so overjoyed for finding,
A lucky four-leaf clover.
And so entranced at saucepan milk,
Rise up and then spill over.

For to view life's simple things,
There lies a simple choice.
We can simply choose to ignore them,
Or enjoy and give them voice.
